/--
A custom tactic that automatically splits the goal on a given boolean hypothesis.
It performs a `by_cases` on the specified identifier and then simplifies.
This tactic is particularly useful when dealing with piecewise-defined functions (e.g., ReLU).

  let hName := ident.getId.toString
  evalTactic <|← `(tactic| by_cases h: $(mkIdent hName); try simp)

/--
Placeholder for integrating an external SMT solver.
In a production system, this function would convert the current goal to SMT-LIB format,
invoke an external SMT solver, and use its response to construct a proof term.
Here, it simply returns the input goal unchanged.

  -- In a full implementation:
  -- 1. Convert `goal` to SMT-LIB.
  -- 2. Call the external solver.
  -- 3. Parse the result and construct a proof term.
